1) Write a function to test whether a list has a loop
   in it. Do this by storing addresses of already visited
   nodes in an array and searching the array for each new
   visit. (Try to avoid using globals. Write extra functions if
   required).


2) Modify the code in tree.c so that it will work with
   the following "main":

   main()
   {
	   struct node *h = 0;
           char s[100];
           while(scanf("%s", s) != EOF)
		h = insert(h, new(s));
   }


3) Complete "encode.c"


4) Let's say I have a struct:

   struct foo {
	int m, k;
	int t;
	int x, y;
   };

   I want a macro which will give me offset of a field; let's say
   I wish to get offsetof `t', I will call:

   offset_of(struct foo, t)

   this will give me 8.

   Define this macro.
