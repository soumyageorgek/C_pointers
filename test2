ead the swap function in "swap.c".


You should write some code in the body of "swap" 
and make it swap `a' and `b' in `main'.

We are NOT passing the address of `a' and `b' to the
swap function.

Use your knowledge of C internals to write the body of swap.

[Note: this is strictly for fun! Don't ever write
code like this]
